3.1.	 Module 1: Core Communication Layer:

The Core Communication Layer is responsible for handling
fundamental Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms and ensuring secure, reliable,
and efficient data exchange between processes. It serves as the foundation for all higher-level security and API functionalities.

1.	Transport Protocol Manager: 
•	Implements multiple IPC mechanisms (shared memory, pipes, sockets, message queues)
•	Provides a unified interface for all transport types
•	Handles protocol-specific optimizations and configurations
•	Manages low-level system resources and handles cleanup

2.	Connection Management System: 
•	Establishes communication channels between processes 
•	Manages connection lifecycles (initiation, maintenance, termination)
•	Handles connection pooling for performance optimization
•	Provides addressing and discovery mechanisms for processes

3.	Resource Management: 
•	Monitors and controls resource usage (memory, file descriptors)
•	Implements throttling mechanisms for high-load scenarios
•	Provides clean termination and resource release
•	Handles deadlock prevention and detection

4.	Error Detection & Recovery:
•	Identifies communication failures and network issues
•	Implements retry mechanisms with configurable policies
•	Provides detailed error information for debugging 
•	Manages graceful degradation in partial failure scenarios
•
