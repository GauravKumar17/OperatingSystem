1.3.	Project Scope
1.	Development of core communication mechanisms: The Secure IPC Framework implements three core communication mechanisms: Shared Memory, Pipes, and Sockets. Each mechanism is designed for secure, efficient, and scalable inter-process communication while integrating encryption, authentication, and access control.

2.	Design of a consistent API across platforms: The API is designed to work across Linux, Windows, and macOS, providing a unified interface for shared memory, pipes, and sockets. 
3.	Support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns: synchronous means Blocking communication where the sender waits for a response.
Asynchronous means Non-blocking communication, allowing parallel execution.

4.	Implementation of access control mechanisms: The Secure IPC Framework
integrates robust access control mechanisms to enforce security policies, prevent unauthorized communication, and protect sensitive data.

5.	Performance testing and optimization: Ensuring high performance in secure inter-proces
s communication (IPC) is critical for real-time systems, high-throughput applications, and low-latency communication.
This section outlines performance testing methodologies and optimization strategies for the Secure IPC Framework.


6.	Support for legacy systems older than 5 years: Ensuring compatibility with legacy systems (5+ years old) is crucial for 
industries where upgrading is costly (e.g., banking, healthcare, industrial automation). The Secure IPC Framework provides backward compatibility while maintaining security and performance.

7.	Support for real-time operating systems: Integrating secure inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms into real-time operating
systems (RTOS) requires low-latency, deterministic, and minimal-overhead designs. The Secure IPC Framework ensures compatibility with RTOS
environments used in embedded systems, industrial automation, automotive, and aerospace applications.

8.	GUI tools for administration: To simplify management, monitoring, and debugging of the Secure IPC Framework, we provide Graphical User Interface
(GUI) tools. These tools offer real-time monitoring, configuration management, and security auditing for IPC mechanisms.
