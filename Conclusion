. Conclusion and Future Scope
	7.1 Conclusion:
The Secure Inter-process Communication Framework provides a robust solution for applications requiring protected data exchange between processes. By implementing a three-layer architecture (Core Communication, Security Services, and API/Integration), the framework delivers a comprehensive security model while maintaining performance and usability. The modular design allows for flexibility and extensibility, making it suitable for various use cases from local applications to distributed systems.
 	7.2 Future Scope:
•	Cross-Platform Mobile Support: Extend the framework to support mobile platforms (iOS, Android)
•	Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Implement post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for future-proofing
•	Blockchain Integration: Add support for blockchain-based authentication and non-repudiation
•	Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection: Implement ML-based detection of unusual communication patterns
•	Formal Verification: Conduct formal verification of critical security components
•	Performance Optimization: Further reduce overhead for high-throughput applications
•	Compliance Certifications: Pursue security certifications (e.g., FIPS 140-3)
•	Extended Protocol Support: Add support for additional specialized protocols
•	Cloud-Native Extensions: Develop optimizations for cloud environments and serverless applications
