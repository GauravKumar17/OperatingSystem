4.	Technologies Used

This section outlines the recommended programming languages, libraries, and tools for implementing a secure inter-process communication (IPC) framework. These technologies ensure performance, security, scalability, and maintainability while supporting various platforms and communication patterns.

4.1.	Programming Languages:
1.	C++:
•	Used for the core IPC implementation requiring high performance and direct system access.
•	Provides low-level control over memory and system resources.
•	Suitable for implementing shared memory, sockets, pipes, and message queues.
•	Works well with security libraries like OpenSSL and libsodium.
Use cases:
•	Core IPC mechanisms (shared memory, pipes, sockets).
•	High-performance and low-latency applications.
•	System-level programming with direct OS interaction.
2.	Rust:
•	Ensures memory safety without garbage collection.
•	Eliminates buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory vulnerabilities.
•	Ideal for security-sensitive IPC applications.
Use cases:
•	Secure IPC framework components (e.g., authentication, encryption).
•	Memory-safe implementations of cryptographic operations.
•	High-reliability systems with strict security requirements.
3.	Python:
•	Used for high-level APIs, scripting, testing, and automation
•	Provides rapid development with libraries for serialization (JSON, Protocol Buffers), networking, and security.
•	Ideal for example applications, debugging tools, and administrative interfaces.
Use cases:
•	API development and integration testing.
•	Writing example applications for end-users.
•	Rapid prototyping of communication layers.
