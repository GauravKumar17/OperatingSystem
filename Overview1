1. Project Overview
The Secure Inter-process Communication (IPC) Framework addresses a critical need in modern software development: enabling processes to communicate securely while protecting against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. As applications become more distributed and modular, secure IPC becomes essential for maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
1.1.	Goals
1.	Security Implementation: Develop a framework that provides end-to-end security for inter-process communication, including:
•	Strong encryption for data confidentiality
•	Message integrity verification to prevent tampering
•	Authentication mechanisms to confirm process identity
•	Authorization controls to enforce access policies
•	Protection against common attack vectors (man-in-the-middle, replay attacks, etc.)

2.	Performance Optimization: Create a framework that maintains reasonable performance while implementing security features:
•	Minimize latency overhead from encryption/decryption
•	Optimize throughput for large data transfers
•	Provide configurable security levels to balance security and performance

3.	Usability and Integration: Design an interface that is:
•	Intuitive for developers to implement
•	Compatible with existing application architectures
•	 Well-documented with clear examples 
•	Flexible enough to support various communication patterns
